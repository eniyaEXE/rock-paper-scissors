So, my first project. Rock paper scissors, a classic beginner project. It won't be good, but I'm trying to improve my skills, so that's to be expected!
Anyways, feel free to leave criticism. ALSO this is my first ever time using github, so there's probably something I did wrong, but oh well.
There's also a lot of things in there like the sleep times and the clear function, these are unnecessary but I added them for aesthetic purposes, also they make it possible for me to practice with defining functions and using the time module, so that's a plus!
So yeah! Cya later for the next one I guess <3
