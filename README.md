So, my first project. Rock paper scissors, a classic beginner project. It won't be good, but I'm trying to improve my skills, so that's to be expected!
Anyways, feel free to leave criticism. ALSO this is my first ever time using github, so there's probably something I did wrong, but oh well.
So yeah! Cya later for the next one I guess <3
